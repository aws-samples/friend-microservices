## Introduction

The Serverless microservices application sample demonstrates how you can build and deploy a solution for friend microservices in gaming applications using API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, and SQS. This application sample allows you to handle friend state management asynchronously and utilizes DynamoDB Streams with Event Source Mapping Filters to reduce the number of transactional writes. With an SQS queue, multiple backend services can send friend actions and handle duplicated messages using Event Source Mapping Filters. An API Gateway and a Lambda Function have been implemented to read the data and DynamoDB for data persistence. The sample is decoupled from player management and only serves friend state management. Users can deploy the infrastructure with AWS Cloud Development Kit, and we will demonstrate how you use LocalStack to deploy the infrastructure on your developer machine and your CI environment.

We are using the following AWS services and their features to build our infrastructure:

## Prerequisites

- LocalStack Pro
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/aws-cli/) with the `awslocal` wrapper.
- [CDK](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/aws-cdk/) with the `cdklocal` wrapper.
- [NodeJS v18.0.0](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) with `npm` package manager.

Start LocalStack Pro by setting your `LOCALSTACK_API_KEY` to activate the Pro features.

```shell
export LOCALSTACK_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
EXTRA_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=* localstack start -d
```

## Instructions

You can build and deploy the sample application on LocalStack by running our `Makefile` commands. To deploy the infrastructure, you can run `make deploy` after installing the application dependencies. To test the deployed infrastructure, you can run `make test` to run sample tests. Here are instructions to deploy and test it manually step-by-step.

### Creating the infrastructure

To create the AWS infrastructure locally, you can use CDK and our `cdklocal` wrapper. Before you can deploy the infrastructure, you need to install the application dependencies:

```shell
yarn
```

To deploy the infrastructure, you can run the following command:

```shell
cdklocal bootstrap aws://000000000000/us-east-1
cdklocal deploy
```

As an output of the last command, you will see the API Gateway endpoint URL. You can use this URL to test the API.

### Testing the microservice

To test the microservice, we will send Friend Action Events to the front SQS queue. We will use the AWS CLI to send the events to the queue. To get the Queue URL, you can run the following command:

```shell
awslocal sqs list-queues
```

Get the URL of the Front Queue and use the following commands to send a friend request event:

```shell
awslocal sqs send-message-batch --queue-url <QUEUE_URL> --entries file://test/testMessagesFirst.json
awslocal sqs send-message-batch --queue-url <QUEUE_URL> --entries file://test/testMessagesSecond.json
awslocal sqs send-message-batch --queue-url <QUEUE_URL> --entries file://test/testMessagesThird.json
```

To test corner cases, you can send the following messages to the queue:

```shell
awslocal sqs send-message-batch --queue-url <QUEUE_URL> --entries file://test/cornerCase1.json
awslocal sqs send-message-batch --queue-url <QUEUE_URL> --entries file://test/cornerCase2.json
```

To test the microservice now, send the following command using `cURL`:

```shell
curl -X GET 'https://<LOCAL_APIGATEWAY_ENDPOINT>/friends/player1'
curl -X GET 'https://<LOCAL_APIGATEWAY_ENDPOINT>/friends/player2'
curl -X GET 'https://<LOCAL_APIGATEWAY_ENDPOINT>/friends/player3'
```
